    "The following part will introduce our methodology on how use our data input and the work flow behind the prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this part of the project we had the returns of each asset and the 10-K* reports of each assets. The best approach was to try and predict the next month price return using the current data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code will act as prediction proxy to our real data. We will implement machine learning models to predict the upcoming returns of the following assets. The idea behind this code will be to run multiple models and get the best model that works for every asset. This method can help on upcoming projects, find the optimal model in the long run for each asset while using tuning of parameters. In this case, tuning is not necessary since there are not enough data points to stretch our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 10-K results were used as input features to predict our returns. To get even more realistic estimates we future shift these financial results by one quarter, for example, we use Q4 results published in late December to estimate price returns in Q1 of the following year. A big challenge for our project was the following dilemma, transform our returns from monthly to quarterly (upscaling) or transform quarterly earnings in monthly (downscaling). \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice was made easier by our dataset length. We had approximately 10 years of data so 120 points, if we chose the upscaling method our dataset would have had a length of 40 points, basically not enough for machine learning methods (ML). Ergo, we chose the late method, using the same earnings for three months consecutively, meaning that we would have the same results for Jan/Feb/March. We added also some lagged price returns (max 2 lags). Yes, rolling mean was choice too but using rolling mean with a window of two is not that significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we choose a window size of 12 starting points. We train our model on the first 12 months and we predict on the following month. We choose to minimize the MAE, to have a better understanding of our error. \n",
    "\n",
    "We predict the (12 + 1) 13th month, and our step size is 1, meaning that our dataset grows in time. The first prediction uses 12 data points, second one uses 13 data points, and the last one uses the (n - 1) data points (n being the length of the dataset).\n",
    "To be precise the full length of our dataset is n - 2 since we lagged the price by two periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the code is flexible, by changing the argument, youâ€™ll get the lags you want and the also quarterly data if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion we obtain for each ticker, the predicted returns, for 105 months. We are using those predictions to construct portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to build 2 strategies, respectively a LO and Long/Short.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our portfolio construction for Long/Short is really simple : we get the five top predicted returns and we buy them. We assume to get 20% of each assets in our portfolio. And we get the five worst predicted returns to short them (in the same way we short 20%). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the predicted returns determine which assets to select, and we can observe in fact the effectif portfolio return. Actually, we are not using special metric to create/select the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, we used a totally different approach with the LO strategy. Firstly, we analyse the correlation between our tickers. For each ticker, we looked if he was too correlated to all others. Then, we develop pack of tickers, with the constraint that each ticker into the pack might be low correlated to all others. So, we had 48 packs of low correlated tickers that represent 48 packs of tickers which can gather to build a diversified portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we generate 200 portfolios for every pack, containing between 2 and 5 assets. So, we get 200 * 48 = 9.600 portfolios. For each portfolio, we generate 1000 random weigths for all his tickers, and we saved those whom allows to minimise the variance of the portfolio (based on the historical variance/correlation matrix). With the predicted return, we compute the portfolio returns, for the 105 months, and we choose between the 9.600 portfolios the one which maximises the portfolio return divide by his volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thereby, it allows us to build for 105 months the optimal portfolios based on predictions and the effective returns per period. \n",
